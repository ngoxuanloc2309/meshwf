/*
 * plc_device.h - Layer 2 (PLC Core)
 *
 * Device identity and runtime health type definitions, per the official
 * data contract in
 * docs/SimplePLC_App_MCU_Structs_v2.0_Self_Describing_Profile.md, section
 * 3.1 (SPLC_DeviceDescriptor_t) and 3.3 (SPLC_DeviceHealth_t,
 * 0x0800-0x0809). SPLC_DeviceDescriptor and SPLC_DeviceHealth are
 * unchanged between v1.7/v1.9/v2.0 (same 20-byte layout) -- V2.0 only adds
 * new register blocks elsewhere (RTC, Diagnostic Control, Function
 * Blocks), it does not change these two structs. This file must not
 * include anything from Layer 0/1
 * (platform or driver headers). This is the porting boundary: Layer 2 must
 * build and unit test on a plain PC toolchain, independent of any real
 * hardware.
 *
 * Scope of this file: struct/enum type definitions only, nothing else.
 * There is deliberately no plc_device.c and no extern g_device_descriptor /
 * g_device_health here. Owning the actual instances and populating them
 * (from Flash-stored HW version, compile-time FW version, board init, and
 * the live scan loop for health) requires calling into Layer 0/1, which
 * Layer 2 is not allowed to do -- the same boundary plc_tag.h documents for
 * tag_table_load_from_flash(). That ownership belongs one layer up (Layer
 * 3/4, e.g. services/ or app/plc_app/plc_engine.c), which is free to
 * #include this header for the type definitions and then declare/populate
 * its own g_device_descriptor / g_device_health instances.
 *
 * This file replaces the earlier drafts left in app/splc_app_config.h and
 * board/board_family.h, which put device-identity data outside the Layer 2
 * porting boundary. Those drafts have been removed; this is the single
 * source for SPLC_DeviceClass / SPLC_*Variant / SPLC_DeviceDescriptor /
 * SPLC_DeviceHealth.
 *
 * See docs/architecture.md, section 2, "Layer 2 - PLC Core".

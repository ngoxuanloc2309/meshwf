 * splc_board_init(): common entry point, same call for every SKU. Calls
 * board_hw_init() internally to do the SKU-specific pin wiring.
 *
 * board_hw_init(): implemented once per SKU (e.g. board_zigbee_io.c,
 * future board_remoteio.c) -- registers that board's real DI/DO/AI
 * channels via plc_io_register_di/do/ai() (services/plc_io/plc_io.h).
 * Only one SKU's .c file is compiled into a given firmware image, so
 * there is never more than one definition of board_hw_init() linked at
 * once despite the shared declaration here.
 *
 * Must be called AFTER tag_table_load_from_flash() (so g_tag_table[]
 * already has the right TAG_DI/TAG_DO/TAG_AI kinds for
 * plc_io_register_*() to validate against) and BEFORE plc_engine_init()
 * per docs/architecture.md / docs/handoff.md section 3 item 11.

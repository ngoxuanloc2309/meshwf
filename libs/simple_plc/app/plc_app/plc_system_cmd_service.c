 * Grace period between accepting SPLC_SYSTEM_CMD_REBOOT and actually
 * calling sx_system_reset(). Needed because plc_modbus_cfg.c's
 * write_system_command() only QUEUES the FC06 response byte -- the USB
 * CDC transport (sx_usb_tiny_write(), tud_cdc_write_flush()) does not
 * synchronously guarantee the App has received it by the time this
 * function is first called with the pending command. Reboot
 * unconditionally right away and, on real hardware, the App's Modbus
 * client is left waiting on a response that a reset MCU can now never
 * send -- indistinguishable, from the App's side, from the exact
 * "operation has timed out" symptom already diagnosed once in this
 * project for a different reason (see docs/handoff.md). A few scan
 * cycles' delay costs nothing (REBOOT is not latency-sensitive) and is
 * comfortably longer than one USB Full-Speed frame's transmission time.
 *
 * PLC_REBOOT_DELAY_MS is a product option (splcopts.h; default 300 ms in
 * config/splc_opt.h).

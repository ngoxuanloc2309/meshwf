 * FLASHSIZE_BASE (0x08FFF80C), which is confirmed by ST's own community
 * forum to cause a Hard Fault on STM32H5 parts -- and even if it didn't
 * fault, FLASH_SIZE_DEFAULT in this CMSIS header falls back to 512 KB, which
 * is wrong for the 256 KB STM32H523CC this project started on.
 *
 * The total size comes from the product option SPLC_FLASH_SIZE_KB
 * (splcopts.h) through splc_flash_define.h, the single place that derives
 * the geometry (total size, two equal banks, 8 KB sectors) and the data
 * regions at the end of Flash. STM32H5 parts are dual-bank with equal banks
 * (e.g. STM32H523CC: 2 x 128 KB, 16 sectors/bank), so a bank is half of the
 * total. Only the sector size is cross-checked against CMSIS below.

 * ROOT CAUSE (confirmed against real hardware): this project enables
 * ICACHE at boot (Core/Src/main.c's MX_ICACHE_Init(), CubeMX-generated).
 * ICACHE caches reads from the whole Flash address space, not just
 * executable code -- so sx_flash_read()'s plain memcpy() from a
 * memory-mapped Flash address can be served from a STALE cache line left
 * over from BEFORE a write, even though the physical Flash cell was
 * reprogrammed correctly. This exactly matches what was observed: after
 * plc_rule_flash_save()'s write-then-read-back-to-verify sequence failed
 * on a brand-new board (both the direct write to sector A and the B->A
 * restore, in the same call), a RAW read of both sectors via
 * STM32CubeProgrammer (which goes through the debug port, not the CPU's
 * own cached bus) showed BOTH sectors still fully erased (0xFF) --
 * meaning HAL_FLASH_Program() had genuinely not written anything, OR
 * (equally possible, and what this fix targets) it HAD written correctly
 * but every read-back this code itself performed afterward -- both the
 * CRC-verify read inside this same write and the external CubeProgrammer
 * session run moments later -- was being served the same stale
 * all-0xFF cache line, matching ST's own documented guidance (ST
 * Community, "STM32H5 ECC errors and ICACHE invalidation": software must
 * invalidate the instruction cache after a Flash write before relying on
 * a subsequent read of that region) rather than a real HAL failure
 * (clearing FLASH_FLAG_ALL_ERRORS alone, tried first, did not fix this --
 * see sx_flash_clear_error_flags() above).
 *
 * HAL_ICACHE_Invalidate() is blocking (waits for the invalidate to
 * complete, ST's own HAL source notes this typically finishes well under
 * ICACHE_INVALIDATE_TIMEOUT_VALUE = 1 ms) -- acceptable here since Flash
 * erase/program are already blocking, multi-millisecond operations on
 * this MCU; this adds negligible relative overhead.

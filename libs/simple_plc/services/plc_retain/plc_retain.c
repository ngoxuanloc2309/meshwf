 * plc_retain.c - Layer 3 (PLC Application Services)
 *
 * Implementation of the retain scheme declared in plc_retain.h. See that
 * file's header comment, app/splc_flash_define.h (Flash layout/size
 * constants), and docs/SimplePLC_RuleStruct_MCU_Spec_v0.1.md section 7
 * for the full design this implements.
 *
 * Record wire layout (SPLC_RETAIN_RECORD_SIZE = 208 bytes -- 200 bytes
 * of real header+entry data, rounded up to the next 16-byte/quad-word
 * multiple so every record slot lands on a Flash-program-legal address;
 * see splc_flash_define.h's SPLC_RETAIN_RECORD_SIZE comment for the
 * real-hardware bug this fixes -- per app/splc_flash_define.h):
 *   offset 0..3   uint32_t seq_num
 *   offset 4..5   uint16_t count       (number of valid entries that follow)
 *   offset 6..7   uint16_t crc16       (CRC-16/MODBUS over the WHOLE
 *                                       SPLC_RETAIN_RECORD_SIZE-byte record,
 *                                       including the 8 bytes of trailing
 *                                       alignment padding, with the crc16
 *                                       field itself treated as 0)
 *   offset 8..207 count x { uint16_t tag_index; int32_t value; }  (6 bytes
 *                                       each, count is always
 *                                       SPLC_RETAIN_TAG_COUNT == 32 in
 *                                       practice -- see below), followed
 *                                       by 8 bytes of unused padding
 *                                       (written as 0 by
 *                                       retain_snapshot_write()'s
 *                                       memset(), never read back by any
 *                                       path in this file)
 *
 * A record always reserves space for SPLC_RETAIN_TAG_COUNT (32) entries
 * on Flash (fixed SPLC_RETAIN_RECORD_SIZE), even though count may be
 * smaller in principle -- this implementation always writes exactly
 * SPLC_RETAIN_TAG_COUNT entries (every TAG_VREG_RETAIN tag, in fixed
 * index order), so count is always SPLC_RETAIN_TAG_COUNT in practice.
 * The field still exists on the wire for forward compatibility and so
 * retain_store_restore() has an explicit, self-describing entry count
 * to loop over rather than assuming the fixed constant forever.

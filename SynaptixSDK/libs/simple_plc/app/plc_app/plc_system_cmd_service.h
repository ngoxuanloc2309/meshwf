/*
 * plc_system_cmd_service.h - Layer 4 (Engine & Application entry)
 *
 * Executes the real-world effect of a SYSTEM_COMMAND (0x0A00) accepted by
 * services/plc_modbus_cfg/plc_modbus_cfg.c's write_system_command(). That
 * file only decodes the command and records it (Layer 3 is transport/
 * protocol-only, per its own header comment); calling into
 * sx_system_reset() (Layer 0/1) or Flash-erasing the rule/retain stores
 * belongs up here instead, per plc_system_cmd.h's (Layer 2) own comment
 * on where this execution boundary sits.
 *
 * Implements all four commands end-to-end: REBOOT here (staggered
 * sx_system_reset()), and CLEAR_RULES / CLEAR_RETAIN / FACTORY_RESET by
 * calling plc_system_clear.h (empty record written through the verified
 * Flash save paths). SYSTEM_COMMAND_RESULT goes ACCEPTED -> DONE, or
 * ERROR + SPLC_ERROR_FLASH if the Flash write could not be verified.

 * MCU, the FC06 ACK for the SYSTEM_COMMAND write that triggered it has
 * already been handed to the transport this same cycle, not merely
 * staged for "next time nmbs_server_poll() runs".
 *
 * Non-blocking in the common case (no command pending: one cheap
 * plc_modbus_cfg_get_pending_system_command() call, nothing else).
 * SPLC_SYSTEM_CMD_REBOOT specifically does NOT act within the same call
 * that first sees it -- see plc_system_cmd_service.c's doc-comment on
 * why it staggers the actual sx_system_reset() a few scan cycles later
 * (letting the ACK physically leave over USB first) rather than calling
 * sx_system_reset() immediately, which never returns.

 * Sentinel meaning "this rule has no guard at all" -- GUARD_TAG_INDEX_MASK
 * (all 15 index bits set = 0x7FFF = 32767) is used instead of 0.
 *
 * WHY NOT 0: under the v1.9 tag layout (board/board_tag_define.h; DI is
 * always the first group regardless of board, per plc_tag.h's
 * tag_di_base_index()), tag index 0 is
 * TAG_DI0 -- a real, addressable tag, not an unused slot. v1.7 reserved
 * index 0 as a dedicated TAG_NONE sentinel with no physical meaning, so
 * "guard_tag == 0 means no guard" was safe back then. v1.9 removed that
 * reserved slot to fit the fixed wire layout (DI 0-7, DO 8-15, ...), which
 * silently broke that assumption: a rule author who set
 * guard_tag = TAG_DI0 (0) *intending* to gate on DI0's real value would
 * instead have had that guard treated as "absent" and always pass,
 * regardless of DI0's actual level -- DI0 would have been the one tag in
 * the whole system that could never be used as a guard. Confirmed by an
 * actual compiled/run test before this fix: a rule with guard_tag=TAG_DI0
 * still fired even with DI0 held at 0.
 *
 * 0x7FFF is safe as the new sentinel because GUARD_TAG_INDEX_MASK is only
 * 15 bits wide, so it can never equal a real tag index: MAX_TAGS is at most 128
 * (see board/board_tag_define.h; 112 on the Zigbee-IO SKU), far below 32767.
 * Every valid tag index (0..MAX_TAGS-1) is therefore always distinguishable
 * from "no guard".
 *
 * rule_table_commit() does not currently reject a guard_tag whose index
 * bits fall in 128..32766 (a value that is neither a valid tag nor this
 * sentinel) -- see the TODO in plc_rule.c's rule_state_machine_step().

 *   - Edge detection without compare, SET/TOGGLE/INC/ADD act on the raw 32-bit
 *     pattern exactly as for an integer rule (ADD_TAG with a float operand is

/*
 * FIX (review vs. spec section 4.1/6.5): the previous signature folded
 * TRG_INTERVAL's period and TRG_TIME_WINDOW's HHMM bounds into this
 * function and additionally reused Rule.for_ms as that period. That
 * collided with for_ms's other, spec-defined meaning (dwell/debounce for
 * ON_CHANGE/ON_RISE/ON_FALL, applied separately in rule_scan()/dwell_ok()):
 * a single field was being interpreted two different ways in the same
 * call, and TRG_INTERVAL rules got an extra, incorrect dwell check applied
 * on top by rule_scan(). This function is now edge-detection only, exactly
 * mirroring the "Trigger (change edge?)" step in architecture.md section
 * 6.5 / spec section 6.5. Timing-based triggers (TRG_TIME_WINDOW,
 * TRG_INTERVAL) are handled by trigger_timing_ok() below instead, which
 * consumes for_ms/threshold_lo/threshold_hi with the meaning the spec
 * actually assigns them per trigger_type (spec section 4.2).
 *
 * Evaluate whether an edge-based trigger condition is currently met.
 * Only meaningful for TRG_ON_CHANGE / TRG_ON_RISE / TRG_ON_FALL.
 * TRG_TIME_WINDOW and TRG_INTERVAL are level/timing triggers, not edges;
 * for those two this function returns true unconditionally so rule_scan()
 * can move on to trigger_timing_ok(), which is the real gate for them.
 *
 * type:      Trigger type to evaluate
 * prev:      Value observed on the previous scan cycle
 * current:   Value observed on the current scan cycle
 *
 * returns: true if the trigger condition is currently satisfied

 *     1600), trigger_tag is ignored. now_hhmm must be wall-clock
 *     time-of-day in HHMM form, NOT a millisecond tick count -- the
 *     previous implementation compared an HHMM threshold against a raw ms

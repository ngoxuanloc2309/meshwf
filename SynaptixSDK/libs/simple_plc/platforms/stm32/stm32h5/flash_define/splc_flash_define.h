/*
 * splc_flash_define.h - Layer 0 (platforms/stm32/stm32h5/flash_define)
 *
 * Flash memory map of the persistent-storage regions, as a set of macros --
 * not a driver, not business logic. Defines WHERE each region lives; the
 * driver (platforms/stm32/stm32h5/flash/stm32h5_flash.c) knows HOW to erase/
 * program a sector and services/plc_retain, services/plc_rule_flash know WHAT
 * goes in each region.
 *
 * The regions are 5 contiguous sectors: by default the last 5 sectors of the
 * chip's Flash, counted backwards from its end, or -- when a host firmware owns
 * the end of the Flash -- a 40 KB hole at SPLC_FLASH_DATA_ADDR (splcopts.h). The only product input is the chip's Flash size,
 * SPLC_FLASH_SIZE_KB (splcopts.h, default in config/splc_opt.h); every
 * address below is derived from it, so moving to another STM32H5 part needs
 * no edit in this file. Every stm32h5_*.h file already #includes
 * sx_platform_config.h (which includes splc_opt.h), and the file is reached
 * by lower and upper layers through the PUBLIC include path of
 * platforms/stm32/stm32h5/CMakeLists.txt.
 *
 * Hardware facts this file is built on (STM32H5, RM0481 / datasheets):
 *   - Sector size 8 KB on every STM32H5 part (FLASH_SECTOR_SIZE in CMSIS).
 *   - Two banks of equal size (SPLC_FLASH_SIZE_KB / 2 each), so the last
 *     sectors are always in bank 2 and the code running from bank 1 keeps
 *     executing while they are erased/programmed. ASSUMPTION to re-check
 *     against the datasheet of any part not yet used: that part is dual-bank
 *     with equal banks (the checks below only prove the 5 sectors fit in
 *     bank 2).
 *   - FLASH_BASE (0x08000000) comes from the CMSIS device header; the size
 *     macros of that header (FLASH_SIZE/FLASH_BANK_SIZE) read a register
 *     that Hard-Faults on STM32H5 and must NOT be used.
 *
 * Layout (offsets counted back from END = FLASH_BASE + total size; the
 * example column is a 256 KB part, STM32H523CC):
 *
 *   Sector (from the end) | Address        | 256 KB example | Region
 *   ----------------------+----------------+----------------+-----------------
 *   last                  | END - 1 sector | 0x0803E000     | Rule Table A (running copy)
 *   2nd from last         | END - 2        | 0x0803C000     | Rule Table B (backup copy)
 *   3rd from last         | END - 3        | 0x0803A000     | Retain sector 3 of 3
 *   4th from last         | END - 4        | 0x08038000     | Retain sector 2 of 3
 *   5th from last         | END - 5        | 0x08036000     | Retain sector 1 of 3 (lowest)
 *
 * The firmware image (.text/.data) must stay below SPLC_FLASH_DATA_BASE_ADDR
 * (END - 5 sectors): set the linker script's FLASH LENGTH to
 * SPLC_FLASH_SIZE_KB minus SPLC_FLASH_RESERVED_SIZE (40 KB).
 *
 * Rule Table: 2 sectors (A/B, 8 KB each), per docs/handoff.md section 1 --
 * see services/plc_rule_flash/plc_rule_flash.h for the full A/B recovery
 * mechanism this supports. Each sector holds one on-Flash record: an
 * 8-byte header (seq_num/rule_count/crc16) plus up to
 * MAX_RULES(100) * sizeof(SPLC_RuleRecord)(32) = 3200 bytes of rule wire
 * data (3208 bytes total max, 39% of one 8 KB sector) -- see
 * core/plc_rule/plc_rule.h. No wear-leveling within a sector (each holds
 * exactly one record, rewritten in place): the Active Rule Table only
 * changes when the App commits a new rule set (rare, human-triggered),
 * unlike Retain which can change every scan cycle -- see
 * docs/architecture.md section 2.6.2 for the commit protocol (staging
 * happens over Modbus registers in RAM/App side; only the final
 * committed table is written to Flash, to BOTH A and B).
 *
 * Retain: 3 contiguous sectors (24 KB) using the rotating EEPROM-emulation
 * scheme from docs/SimplePLC_RuleStruct_MCU_Spec_v0.1.md section 7,
 * updated for v1.9's 32-slot VREG_RETAIN range (the v0.1 spec's own
 * numbers -- 104 byte/record, ~78 records/sector, 64 KB/8 sectors -- were
 * computed for the OLD 16-slot VREG_RETAIN layout and do not apply
 * as-is; see the recomputed constants below). Reduced from the original
 * 4 sectors to 3 to free one sector (the former 4th Retain sector) for Rule Table B
 * -- per docs/handoff.md section 1.1 point 1, this trade was made
 * deliberately with the user rather than growing the total reserved
 * Flash region.
 *
 * Endurance at these 3 sectors, 32 retain slots, RETAIN_SNAPSHOT_PERIOD_MS
 * = 5 minutes (docs/SimplePLC_RuleStruct_MCU_Spec_v0.1.md section 7.1):
 * still comfortably sufficient (on the order of ten years) before
 * exhausting the ~10,000 erase-cycle endurance typically quoted for
 * STM32H5 Flash sectors, even after losing one sector to Rule Table B --
 * accepted as sufficient for this product's expected service life (see
 * chat discussion; no consumer gateway device is expected to still be the
 * same physical unit in active use after 10+ years). If
 * RETAIN_SNAPSHOT_PERIOD_MS is ever configured shorter over Modbus
 * (docs/architecture.md's config knob), this endurance budget shrinks
 * proportionally -- worth re-checking before allowing very short periods.

/*
 * BUGFIX (found on real hardware, confirmed via STM32CubeProgrammer's
 * raw SWD read -- bypasses ICACHE, so this is the true Flash content,
 * not a stale-cache artifact): the natural record size
 * (SPLC_RETAIN_HEADER_SIZE + SPLC_RETAIN_ENTRY_SIZE * SPLC_RETAIN_TAG_COUNT)
 * is 200 bytes, which is NOT a multiple of 16.
 *
 * STM32H5's HAL_FLASH_Program() only supports FLASH_TYPEPROGRAM_QUADWORD
 * (16-byte-aligned writes) -- there is no smaller program granularity on
 * this part. retain_record_addr() places record N at
 * sector_base + N * SPLC_RETAIN_RECORD_SIZE, so with a 200-byte record,
 * every ODD-numbered slot (1, 3, 5, ...) starts 8 bytes off a 16-byte
 * boundary (200 % 16 == 8). sx_flash_write() (platforms/stm32/stm32h5/
 * flash/stm32h5_flash.c) walks the buffer in 16-byte quad-words starting
 * from that misaligned address, so EVERY quad-word it programs for that
 * record lands on a misaligned address and HAL_FLASH_Program() rejects
 * all of them (observed on real hardware: 13/13 quad-words of the
 * affected record failed, logged as repeated
 * "HAL_FLASH_Program failed ... status=1" -- not a partial/random
 * failure, and not caused by the destination not being erased: a raw
 * SWD read of the failing address showed it was still cleanly erased
 * (0xFF) right up until the misalignment kicked in). Even-numbered slots
 * (0, 2, 4, ...) always happened to land on a 16-byte boundary again
 * (200 * 2 = 400 = 16 * 25), which is why slot 0 wrote fine and only
 * every second write ever failed -- easy to miss in short test runs.
 *
 * This was invisible in normal testing because it only bites once
 * retain_snapshot_write() has been called enough times to reach an odd
 * slot index -- with RETAIN_SNAPSHOT_PERIOD_MS's default of 5 minutes,
 * that only surfaces after the device has been left running
 * uninterrupted for 5+ minutes, which most short manual test sessions
 * never reach.
 *
 * Fix: round SPLC_RETAIN_RECORD_SIZE itself up to the next 16-byte
 * multiple (200 -> 208). Every record slot is then a whole multiple of
 * 16 bytes apart, so slot N's address (sector_base + N * 208) is always
 * 16-byte aligned for every N, not just even ones. The extra 8 bytes are
 * unused padding at the end of every record (never read: every read
 * path in plc_retain.c bounds its use of a record by `count`, the
 * header, or the CRC region -- none of them iterate past
 * RETAIN_RECORD_ENTRIES_OFFSET + count * SPLC_RETAIN_ENTRY_SIZE). No
 * other change is required anywhere else: services/plc_retain/
 * plc_retain.c already computes every record address, buffer size, and
 * CRC span purely from SPLC_RETAIN_RECORD_SIZE (see that file's own
 * header comment), so a single-point fix here is sufficient -- verified
 * by grep across plc_retain.c/.h for every use of this constant.
 *
 * Trade-off: SPLC_RETAIN_RECORDS_PER_SECTOR drops from 40 to 39 (8 KB /
 * 208, floored) -- a ~2.5% reduction in usable retain history per
 * sector, well within the Flash-endurance budget this file's header
 * comment already computes (~10 years) for RETAIN_SNAPSHOT_PERIOD_MS's
 * default 5-minute period.

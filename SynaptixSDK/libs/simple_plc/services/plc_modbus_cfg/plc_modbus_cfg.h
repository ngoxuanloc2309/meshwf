 * plc_modbus_cfg.h - Layer 3 (PLC Application Services)
 *
 * Modbus config/monitor server -- the App<->MCU channel per
 * docs/SimplePLC_App_MCU_Structs_v1.9_Self_Describing_Profile.md
 * section 8 (MODBUS REGISTER MAP V1). Owns exactly one nanoMODBUS server
 * instance (nmbs_t), backed by whichever concrete transport the caller
 * hands in as a modbus_transport_t (port/modbus_transport/
 * modbus_transport.h, Layer 3.5).
 *
 * This file is transport-agnostic on purpose: it does not include
 * sx_usb_cdc.h, sx_uart.h, or any other Layer 1 driver header, and does
 * not know or care whether the App is connected over USB-CDC (Remote I/O
 * SKU, see port/modbus_usb/modbus_usb.c), RS485/UART, or Modbus TCP
 * (future Gateway variants). Board init (Layer 4) is the only place that
 * knows which physical transport a given firmware build uses; it builds
 * the appropriate modbus_transport_t (e.g. via
 * modbus_transport_usb_create(), port/modbus_usb/modbus_usb.h) and passes
 * it to plc_modbus_cfg_init() below. See modbus_transport.h's own header
 * comment for the full rationale and the problem this replaced (a
 * previous version of this file took a sx_usb_tiny_t* directly).
 *
 * Scope: read-only exposure of DEVICE_DESCRIPTOR, DEVICE_RESOURCE_INFO,
 * ACTIVE_RULE_TABLE, DEVICE_HEALTH, RUNTIME_TAG_VALUES, SYSTEM_COMMAND(_RESULT),
 * plus the Rule Transfer staging/commit protocol at 0x9000-0xA001 (section
 * 9). This file owns the RAM instances of SPLC_DeviceDescriptor /
 * SPLC_DeviceResourceInfo / SPLC_DeviceHealth -- Layer 2 (plc_device.h)
 * only defines their types, per that header's own comment ("That
 * ownership belongs one layer up").
 *
 * May include Layer 0/1 headers directly (sx_time.h for uptime) --
 * Layer 3 is not required to build/test hardware-free, unlike Layer 2.
 * See docs/architecture.md section 3 for the full include-direction
 * table. The one Layer 1 header this file does NOT include on purpose is
 * any concrete transport driver header (sx_usb_cdc.h, sx_uart.h) -- see
 * the transport-agnostic note above.

 *
 * transport->unit_id MUST be 1..247 on RTU. nanoMODBUS rejects 0 (the

 * unit_id was "accepted but not checked"; that was wrong.)
 *
 * If nmbs_server_create() fails, this function logs the error and leaves
 * the Modbus server DISABLED: modbus_config_service() then still pumps
 * the transport but never calls nmbs_server_poll() (polling an
 * uninitialized nmbs_t would call a NULL function pointer -> HardFault).

 *      already been initialized (e.g. sx_usb_tiny_init() already called)

 *      driver instance transport->ctx refers to must outlive every
 *      future modbus_config_service() call (same instance passed as
 *      nmbs_platform_conf.arg for the lifetime of the server).
 *
 * Called once at boot, from plc_engine_init() (Layer 4), AFTER
 * tag_table_load_from_flash() and rule_table_load_from_flash() (so
 * DEVICE_RESOURCE_INFO's counts and RULE_TABLE_INFO's rule_count already
 * reflect real data when the App's first read request arrives) -- see

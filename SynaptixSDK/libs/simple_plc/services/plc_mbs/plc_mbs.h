/*
 * plc_mbs.h - Layer 3. Modbus RTU SLAVE serving (SPLC-SPEC-SLAVE-001).
 *
 * An RS-485 port that the App set to the Slave role (port table 0x1400, +14 = 1, +15 = Slave
 * ID; see plc_mbm.h) is listened to here: a SCADA master reads and writes the device's tags
 * through a FIXED map, independent of the rule table. The UART binding and line settings come
 * from plc_mbm (the host's splc_mbm_set_rs485_port()); this module only reads and writes
 * bytes of a port that plc_mbm_port_role() says is a Slave. A Slave port is never a Master, so
 * nobody else touches its bytes.
 *
 * Function codes: FC01 / FC05 / FC15 (coils), FC02 (discrete inputs), FC03 / FC06 / FC16
 * (holding registers). Anything else (FC04 included) -> exception 0x01. Unit ID 0 is a
 * broadcast: writes are executed, nothing is sent back.
 *
 * Map (all 32-bit values are two registers, HIGH word first, like the rest of the wire):
 *   Holding   0x0000        DI_WORD     RO  bit i = DI i (DI 0..15; a bit with no DI reads 0)
 *             0x0001        DO_WORD     RW  bit i = DO i (a bit with no DO is ignored on write)
 *             0x0002..0x0003 VFLAG_DWORD RW  bit i = VFLAG i (0..31)
 *             0x0010..0x0017 AI0..3      RO  float32, one per two registers (see below)
 *             0x0020..0x005F VREG0..31   RW  the tag's 32 bits (INT32, or float bits of a REAL)
 *             0x0060..0x009F VREG_R0..31 RW  retained VREG
 *             0x00A0..0x00AF COUNTER0..7 RW  the counter tag
 *             0x00F0..0x00FF SYS_DIAG    RO  uptime, scan time, status_flags, RTC (see below)
 *   Coils     0x0000..0x000F DO0..15     RW
 *             0x0064..0x0083 VFLAG0..31  RW
 *   Discrete  0x0000..0x000F DI0..15     RO
 * A group entry the board does not have reads 0 (DI 5 on a 4-DI board, VREG 20 when the layout
 * has 12). Writes: a DO / VFLAG bit without a tag is ignored (ACK); a VREG / VREG_R / COUNTER
 * entry beyond the board's count is refused with 0x02, for the whole request, before any
 * entry is written (ICD v2.12.0, CHKL-SLAVE-04).
 * Exceptions: function code not served 0x01; address outside the map, a hole between groups, or a
 * request crossing two regions 0x02 (DI_WORD 0x0000, DO_WORD 0x0001 and VFLAG_DWORD
 * 0x0002..0x0003 are THREE regions: CHKL-SLAVE-04); bad quantity / byte count
 * 0x03; write that touches a read-only register 0x03; write while a diagnostic session holds
 * the tags (the rule engine is suspended) 0x06.
 * FC06 on a 32-bit entry changes only the addressed half (FC16 is the way to write all of it).
 *
 * Firmware choices the ICD does not settle (change here, in plc_mbs.c):
 *  - The tag index of every group follows the board's dense layout (tag_*_base_index()), NOT
 *    the fixed indices in the ICD sample code.
 *  - AI: the tag's raw value as float32, i.e. (float)value for an INT32 tag and the stored
 *    bits for a REAL tag; no scaling. The ICD says "normalised voltage" without a formula.
 *  - SYS_DIAG (layout fixed by the ICD): 0x00F0..F1 uptime_s (u32), 0x00F2 scan_time_ms (u16,
 *    saturates at 65535), 0x00F3 status_flags, 0x00F4 reserved 0, 0x00F5..FA RTC LOCAL time
 *    (year 4 digits, month, day, hour, minute, second), 0x00FB..FF reserved 0.
 *    status_flags: bit0 ENGINE_RUNNING (no diagnostic session holds the tags), bit1 FORCE_ACTIVE
 *    (a diagnostic session does), bit2 BATTERY_LOW (always 0: no battery), bit3 RTC_SYNCED,
 *    bit4 FLASH_DIRTY (retain tags changed since the last snapshot), bit5 RS485_BUS_FAULT
 *    (always 0 until the App defines what counts), bits 6..15 = 0. The RTC words are 0 while
 *    the clock is not synced or the Host has not written the timezone since boot.
 *  - Writes are refused (0x06) while the rule engine is suspended by a diagnostic session.
 *
 * Framing: a frame is complete as soon as its length is known (8 bytes, or 9 + byte count
 * for FC15/FC16) and its CRC is right, so the answer leaves in the same scan. Bytes of other
 * devices' frames on a shared bus are skipped by sliding one byte at a time until a valid
 * frame for this unit shows up; a rest that stays incomplete for 3.5 character times
 * (at least one scan) is dropped. No turnaround delay is configurable on a Slave (+5/+6/+7 of
 * its port record are ignored).
 *
 * Threading: single-threaded, engine context only. Compiled only with
 * SPLC_MODBUS_SLAVE_ENABLE = 1.

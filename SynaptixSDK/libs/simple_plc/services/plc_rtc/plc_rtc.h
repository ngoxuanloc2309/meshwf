/*
 * plc_rtc.h - Layer 3 (PLC Application Services)
 *
 * The RTC register block (0x0810..0x0813, Wire Profile V2.0, Structs doc
 * section 3.4) and the local time of day the Rule Engine's TRG_TIME_WINDOW
 * needs (Structs doc section 7).
 *
 * Wire layout, 4 registers:
 *   0x0810..0x0811  epoch_utc_s   uint32, High Word first   Host writes
 *   0x0812          tz_offset_min int16  (+420 = UTC+7)     Host writes
 *   0x0813          status_flags  uint16                    READ-ONLY, board-reported
 *
 * status_flags is NEVER taken from the Host. It is computed on every read:
 *   SYNCED      <- sx_rtc_is_synced()   (a Host has set the time)
 *   HW_PRESENT  <- g_rtc_caps.hw_present (set by the board's own init)
 *   BATTERY_LOW <- always 0 (no board reports it yet)
 * so a Host that still sends a 4th register has it ignored.
 *
 * The timezone offset lives in RAM only (never Flash) and applies at the
 * moment the Host writes it. Until it has been written since boot,
 * plc_rtc_get_local_hhmm() reports "no valid time" even if the RTC itself
 * kept its time across a warm reset: without the offset the local hour
 * would silently be UTC.
 *
 * This file is transport-agnostic: it does not include nanomodbus.h.
 * plc_modbus_cfg.c maps plc_rtc_write()'s result onto Modbus exceptions.
